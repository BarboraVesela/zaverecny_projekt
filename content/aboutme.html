                <p>My name is Barbora. Czech born and bred but have lived in The Netherlands since 2012. As the saying goes, I also appreciated the amazing nature and mountains back home only when I was no longer near them. In my free time I hop around my favourite local natural areas and spend my evenings planning the next trip to somewhere hilly.</p>
                <p>On this website I am sharing some tips on local hiking trails, reports from my trips aborad and reviews on my favourite gear.</p>
