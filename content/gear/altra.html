        <h2 class="altra__secondary">A Lightweight Trail Running Shoe</h2>


        <p class="altra__paragraph">The weather during my hike in Scotland was perhaps unsurprisingly the wettest I have ever experienced. Only a few boggy kilometres into the trail it became apparent that any expensive gore-tex leather boot was doomed to fail. Soon those that I had on were filled with water which is an issue as you are more prone to blisters and other sort of nasty issues with your feet. Also, and that was perhaps a much bigger letdown, the soaked leather becomes so heavy that until you are lucky to dry the boots (and repeat the process within hours back on the trail) you are carrying two heavy bricks on your feet. Add the already heavy backpack and the strenuousness of the long-distance hike and tendonitis didn't take long to join the party.</p>

        
        <p class="altra__paragraph">
        After this painful experience and being prone to rolling my ankles I decided to explore other options. In an online forum I found a recommendation to use trail running shoes combined with waterproof socks (which I will cover in another article). The most popular ones among the Pacific Crest Trail hikers seemed to be the Altra Lone Peak.. With my birthday coming up, I put them on my wishlist and soon could test them, albeit just on the sandy flat paths around my house.

        <h3 class="altra__tertiary">Zero-Drop</h3>
        <p class="altra__paragraph">The Altra Lone Peak is a zero drop shoe which means that unlike in a regular shoe, your heel and forefoot rest at the same distance from the ground. The opinions on the zero drop vary but many people swear by it claiming it fixed their issues with lower back pain, knee pain, you name it. If you are new to zero drop shoes you do need to allow yourself to adjust gradually. And gradually means that at first you may be able to wear them for 20 minutes a day and build up until you don't feel your calf muscles stretching uncomfortably.</p>
        

        <h3 class="altra__tertiary">'Foot-shaped not shoe-shaped'
        </h3>
        <p class="altra__paragraph">Altra started as a brand offering alternatives to the snug and pointy regular running shoes. They offer training, road and trail models which, while they vary in width throughout, the shape is always  round and wide around the toes. This helps them spread naturally, accommodate swelling on long hikes and also prevent blisters. It is my firm belief that the added stability when splaying my toes prevents me from rolling my ankles as it hasn't happened since I have started hiking in them.

        <h3 class="altra__tertiary">Weight</h3>
        <p class="altra__paragraph">Lone Peak is somewhere between a traditional trail running and a minimalist shoe. The stack height is 25mm and Altra uses their own Alter EGO foam in the midsole of the shoe. Along with the lightweight mesh upper, they certainly don't provide as much support or protection for your feet as hiking boots. Unlike their heavier counterparts though, they are comfortable straight out of the box and don't require breaking in.</p>


        <h3 class="altra__tertiary">Traction</h3>
        <p class="altra__paragraph">This shoe is built to be used on unpaved trails and it performs well there. The sole is dotted with trail claw lugs which help with traction and I could walk comfortably on steeper slopes without the fear of slipping.</p>
        
        <h3 class="altra__tertiary">Durability
        </h3>
        <p class="altra__paragraph">All the pros listed above are of course at the cost of the shoe durability. A lightweight, breathable and flexible shoe cannot compare with the longevity of a hiking boot. The soles suffer particularly on hard surfaces, such as paved paths, so you need to use them in their intended terrain. With the latest model 6 I haven't had any issue with the stitching or the mesh upper.

        <h3 class="altra__tertiary">Other features
        </h3>
        <p class="altra__paragraph">AThe Lone Peaks feature connection points called gaiter trap on the front of the shoe and the heel where you can attach lightweight, warm weather gaiters keeping sand or stones out.

        <h3 class="altra__tertiary">Testing on the JMT
        </h3>
        <p class="altra__paragraph">The first time I could test the shoe on a strenuous hike was on the John Muir Trail.I was a little apprehensive about venturing out into the Sierras for 8 days with a heavy backpack (carrying all the food for 2 people) without any backup option. The Lone Peaks performed above all my expectations however. They were comfortable and breathable despite the hot and dry August weather and I had no issues with stability even with the added weight on my back. Paired with the gaiters, the only issue was that the finest dust got through the textile upper and made my socks dirty.</p>

        <p class="altra__paragraph">On the detour from the official trail via Cecile Lake, I did miss a more solid upper in the steep descent down to the Iceberg Lake. The loose scree and stones tend to roll over the shoes which are offering little protection in such cases. This particular part of the trail was less than 1% of the total planned route so overall it still paid off to wear the lighter shoes.</p>
            
        <p class="altra__paragraph">In short, these shoes are heaven-sent in my opinion and I would encourage everyone to give them a shot. For some they work great, others will go back to the tried and tested traditional hiking boot. For me, unless it is winter of course, there is no looking back!</p>
