        <h2 class="jmt__secondary">Eight days on California's Best Known Long Distance Trail</h2>

        <blockquote class="jmt__snippet">
            A 340 km long trail named in honour of Scottish naturalist John Muir, passing through some of the most breathtaking mountain scenery in the US. It begins in Happy Isles in Yosemite Valley and ends on top of Mt.Whitney, the highest mountain in the contiguous United States. 
        </blockquote>

        <p class="jmt__paragraph">It had been my dream to walk this trail but reading about the logistical and physical challenges it entailed, I never thought I would be able to do it. Only later I realised that I could also section hike the trail and not worry too much about the resupply strategy. With this idea removing some of my worries, I started researching information on the different sections, permits and transport to trailheads. I believe overall the planning probably took me more than the time I spent on the trail but it certainly paid off.</p>
        <p class="jmt__paragraph">My hiking partner was my mum who at the age of 63 was brave enough to trust me, my navigation and planning skills and also her arthritic hip to take her over the mountains safely to Yosemite. We were lucky to snatch a permit from the Duck Pass trailhead located in Mammoth Lakes, California. The town is 2400 m above the sea level and as such is a popular acclimatisation place for many JMT hikers. Besides it is also home to Roberto's Cafe where we ate our last proper meal before setting off which I often longer for later on the trail.</p>

        <h3 class="jmt__tertiary">Day 1 | Duck Pass Trailhead to Deer Creek</h3>

        <p class="jmt__paragraph">After dropping the car at the airport and getting a lift from the lovely owner of The Mammoth Creek Inn where we stayed the night, we hopped on the gondola and got off at the Lake Mary Coldwater Campground. This is where I turned the tracking on my Garmin inReach so that my partner could follow us on the map and know that we were safe even when we had no reception. The trail led us through the campground to the trailhead and from there continued steeply uphill passing several beautiful alpine lakes before reaching Duck Pass. From there we descended towards Duck Lake. From there it was just a short moment before we joined the John Muir Trail and headed north towards Deer Creek. This section between the Duck Lake outlet and Deer Creek was about 8 km long with no water source. The trail was soft and the dust swirled up in the air, filling my nostrils and reminding me of the droughts California has been experiencing. Finally we reached the creek and found a secluded spot next to a large boulder.</p>
        <p class="jmt__paragraph"> One of the musts on the trail is to carry a bearcan in which you store all your food and scented items. It is recommended to place it some 30 m away from your tent as the bear smells its contents anyways and you certainly don't want him to be too close to you as he tries to figure out how to open the lid. Having found a spot, I lodged the bearcan between a boulder and a fallen tree and curled up in my sleeping bag for some well-deserved rest.</p>

        <p class="jmt__spacer">***</p>

        <h3 class="jmt__tertiary">Day 2 | Deer Creek to Johnston Meadow</h3>

        <p class="jmt__paragraph">Both feeling quite refreshed and my mum's hip holding up, we set off on the trail again, this time heading towards Red's Meadow. At the beginning we were mostly passing through the forest which later opened up to reveal Red Cones, two cone-shaped hills formed in a cinder eruption. Shortly after, the forest thinned out altogether and we hiked in the scorching sun through an area hit by The Rainbow Fire several decades earlier. Red's Meadow has a small store, cafe and amenities such as showers available to hikers. We took a burger and a beer and continued on our journey passing the Devil's Postpile Monument, a rare columnar basalt formation towering up to 20 metres on the right from the trail. We decided to camp that night close to the Minaret Creek, where we took a dip in the refreshingly cold water.

        <h3 class="jmt__tertiary">Day 3 | Johnston Meadow to Minaret Lake</h3>
        
        <p class="jmt__paragraph">While short on a map, this part of the planned side trip towards Minaret Lake proved to be more challenging than anticipated. We were lucky to have plenty of time to take regular stops and chat to other fellow hikers who were descending back to Mammoth Lakes having spent the weekend at the lake. Besides the backpackers we also met a friendly local man who was out on a run. By noon he had covered the stretch which we planned to hike over two days. Somewhat ashamed of being out of shape, we continued huffing and puffing up the hill, finally reaching the lake. Well, it wasn't a lie that it is a real gem!
        </p>
        <p class="jmt__paragraph">We enjoyed the afternoon at the lake, swimming, washing our clothes and cooking dinner. I must admit that I was a little worried about how the next day's section towards Cecile and Iceberg Lake would go considering my mum's hip.</p>

        <h3 class="jmt__tertiary">Day 4 | Minaret Lake to Garnet Lake</h3>
        <p class="jmt__paragraph">After a steep climb up to Cecile Lake which went much smoother than I had feared, we continued along its shore towards the outlet. While we did have amazing views on the Minarets towering over the lake, our progress in the pathless terrain was just so slow. We had to jump from a boulder to another and it was only around lunchtime that we could start our descent towards Iceberg Lake. I read the warnings about how steep this section was and how dangerous it can be, especially since it is in a constant shade and the snow and ice can often linger on well into the summer months. It was dry, that I checked before in other hikers' trail reports but I didn't realise just how tricky it would be to climb down on the loose scree.</p>

        <p class="jmt__paragraph">My mum is a trooper though and with just a little help from my part to keep her stable in the difficult sections, we made it down to Iceberg Lake. From then on, the path felt so easy in comparison and we could move a bit faster towards Ediza Lake. We stopped there for a short break and enjoyed the beauty of the place. Feeling somewhat sad we didn't have more days to change plans and camp at the lake, we set off again hoping to camp at Garnet Lake that night. The strenuous hike over Cecile Lake earlier and the hot weather took its toll on my mum and I feared we would need to bail out. We took several longer breaks, pouring some cold water on our heads and dipping our feet in the creeks which helped her regain energy and we reached Garnet Lake an hour before sunset. </p>

        <h3 class="jmt__tertiary">Day 5 | Garnet Lake to Lyell Canyon</h3>
        
        <p class="jmt__paragraph">The evening before we were both so tired that we didn't even appreciate the beauty of the lake. It is truly a wonderful spot as we sat there in the morning looking at Mt Ritter shining in the morning sun. Reluctantly, we packed and continued towards Thousand Island Lake which was maybe even more beautiful than Garnet Lake. I couldn't resist taking dozens of pictures and soon we were walking again, this time towards Donohue Pass. The climb up was a torture alleviated only by the amazing views on the Sierras. The pass forms the boundary between the Ansel Adams Wilderness we were leaving and the Yosemite National Park which opened up in front of us as we reached the highest point. After a brief break we started descending into the beautiful Lyell Canyon and camped close to the Lyell Fork which meanders through the valley.</p>

        <p class="jmt__spacer">***</p>

        <h3 class="jmt__tertiary">Day 6 | Lyell Canyon to Cathedral Lakes</h3>
        <p class="jmt__paragraph">The trail through Lyell was lovely and we admired the lush meadows that surrounded us. As we were approaching Tuolumne Meadows, we noticed thick smoke rising above the hills in front of us and later we learned it was a new wildfire which had started just a day earlier. Knowing that from Tuolumne Meadows onwards we would be heading away from the fire, we were not too concerned and enjoyed a little break at the local store. From there we headed towards Cathedral Lakes which is possibly the most magical place I have ever been. We enjoyed a swim in the lake and as we were returning to the tent, we noticed the smoke had filled up the valley below and coloured the sunset in deep red and purple. Overnight, the smoke reached the lakes and we were forced to sleep in our face N95 masks I had purchased specifically for this purpose.

        <h3 class="jmt__tertiary">Day 7 | Cathedral Lakes to Sunrise Lakes</h3>
        <p class="jmt__paragraph">The smoke had mostly dissipated by the morning and we could continue quite comfortably towards Sunrise Lakes. The day was hot again and we were dragging our feet past the Sunrise Camp (where we got a bit lost) and towards the Sunrise Lakes. Exhausted, we took a long break at the lakes, boiled some coffee and rummaged in the bearcan for some treats other than a Cliff bar. Setting off again we could smell the smoke coming from a wildfire that had been burning since well before we even left home. The wind was blowing the smoke away so we continued on our journey and reached a small creek a few kilometres after Sunrise Lakes. We camped there, feeling somewhat alone for the first time as there were no other hikers camping anywhere nearby. </p>

        <h3 class="jmt__tertiary">Day 8 | To Clouds Rest and Yosemite Valley</h3>
        <p class="jmt__paragraph">This was the last day of our journey and we were rewarded by the amazing views from Clouds Rest down towards Yosemite Valley, Half Dome and the rest of Yosemite NP. The only stain on the otherwise perfect day was the thick black smoke which had filled up the valley. It seemed as an unwise move to descend right into it, let alone stay the night there. I considered several alternatives and consulted hikers who were walking in the opposite direction. They reassured us that the smoke is mostly gone by the afternoon and only comes back at night. Knowing that we had to catch the bus early the next day at the Visitor Center, we decided to make it all the way into the valley that day. Here I would like to express my appreciation to everyone who starts their hike in the Yosemite Valley. The nearly 2000 m altitude difference was a real killer which didn't allow me to enjoy the scenery around me as much as I would have liked. We took plenty of stops and also a dip in the river close to Little Yosemite Valley campsite and made it just before sunset to the backpacker's campground in the valley. 
        </p>
        <p class="jmt__paragraph">Demanding as it was, we loved every second on the trail. We saw some of the most amazing landscape there is and met so many lovely and friendly people. Of course, we will be back to walk the next section of the John Muir Trail.</p>
